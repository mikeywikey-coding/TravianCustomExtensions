Travian Watchman Pro
Travian Watchman Pro is a high-performance browser extension designed to help Travian players manage their empire with precision. It automatically tracks building queues, hero movements, and incoming attacks across multiple servers, providing a real-time floating dashboard directly on your game screen.

Key Features
Smart Building Tracker
Automatic Queue Sync: Automatically detects and tracks every building in your construction queue.

Multi-Village Awareness: Labels alarms with the specific village name so you know exactly where your resources are being spent.

⚔️ Hero & Combat Intelligence
Hero Lock: Efficiently tracks your hero. It cross-references coordinates in tooltips to specify if your hero is returning to a specific village or heading to an adventure/oasis.

Attack Alerts: Scans the Rally Point to highlight incoming attacks and raids with high-visibility cyan and gold indicators.

Single-Server Integrity: One hero per server? One alarm per server. No duplicates when switching villages.

Advanced UI/UX
Glassmorphism Design: A sleek, semi-transparent floating widget that clears the game header.

Map Awareness: The widget intelligently hides itself when you enter Fullscreen Map mode to keep your view unobstructed.

Visual Priority System: Overdue alarms flash bright red to ensure you never miss a finished construction.

Presets
Quick Presets: Use the lightning bolt menu to instantly add 15m, 30m, or custom-timed alarms.

Recurring Alarms: Toggle the ↺ icon on any shortcut to make it automatically reset once finished—perfect for party celebrations or resource production cycles.
